Nikola's dotfiles
=================

## To install

Run the following in your home directory:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/topalovic/.dot
$ .dot/setup
```

:facepunch: Bam. Done.


## To customize

The setup script will symlink the appropriate files in `.dot` to your home
directory. All further hacking should take place in `~/.dot/files`.

To configure git, create `~/.private/gitconfig` containing your private info:

```
[user]
  name  = Nikola TopaloviÄ‡
  email = nikola@example.org

[github]
  user  = topalovic
  token = <github-token>
```


## To uninstall

Just run the unlink script:

```sh
$ .dot/unlink
```

This will remove all recognized dotfile links from your home folder.
